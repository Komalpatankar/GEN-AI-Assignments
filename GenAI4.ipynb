            "Context: Machine learning models are computational systems that learn patterns from data. The main types include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning models learn from labeled training data to make predictions or classifications. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.  Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers. These deep neural networks excel at tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.  The training process for ML models involves feeding them data, calculating errors using loss functions, and adjusting model parameters through optimization algorithms like gradient descent. Models must be carefully evaluated to prevent overfitting, where they perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new data. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Transfer learning is a technique where models pre-trained on large datasets are fine-tuned for specific tasks. This approach saves computational resources and can achieve good results with less training data. Examples include BERT for natural language processing and ResNet for computer vision tasks.\n",
